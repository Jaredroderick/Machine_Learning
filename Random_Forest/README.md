# Chapter 2: Random Forests

## Overview

This chapter introduces random forest models, an ensemble learning method built from collections of decision trees. Using multiple datasets, we explore how random forests improve predictive performance and robustness through bootstrapping and feature randomness, with a focus on classification and benchmarking
